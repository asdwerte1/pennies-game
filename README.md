# pennies-game
This is an implementation of the simple Pennies Game challenge\
The game is fairly simple, it is user against computer\
The game starts with 20 "pennies", and the user and computer take it in turns to remove pennies\
On a move, there may be between 1 and 5 pennies taken, no more and no less\
The loser of the game is the one who removes the final penny, resulting in zero being left\
